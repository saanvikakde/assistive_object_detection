YOLOv5 Assistive Object Detection and Voice Recognition

This project integrates real-time object detection using YOLOv5 with a voice interaction system. The project uses OpenCV for video capture, PyTorch for the YOLOv5 model, and pyttsx for a text-to-speech functionality. The application is intended to aid visually impaired and/or individuals requiring auditory feedback. The program listens for voice commands to detect the nearby surroundings and relays them to the user.
